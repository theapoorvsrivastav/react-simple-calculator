# react-calculator-test
a simple react calculator component

Goal 1

Build the basic UI for the calculator, which has the following elements:
1. An area at the top to display the input or result
2. 10 buttons for numbers 0-9
3. 4 buttons for operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply & Divide)
4. Clear button (completely clears the stack, akin to AC in a real calculator)
5. = button (computes and displays the result)
6. Operation buttons also compute and display intermediate results

Here’s an example of how it must function:
Default state must display ‘0’
1. Pressing the key [ ‘2’ ] shows the operand ‘2’
2. Pressing the keys [ ‘2’ ‘+’ ] in sequence continues to show operand ‘2’
3. Pressing the keys [ ‘2’ ‘+’ ‘3’ ] in sequence shows operand ‘3’
4. Pressing the keys [ ‘2’ ‘+’ ‘3’ ‘-’ ] in sequence shows intermediate result ‘5’
5. Pressing the keys [ ‘2’ ‘+’ ‘3’ ‘-’ ‘1’ ] in sequence shows operand ‘1’
6. Pressing the keys [ ‘2’ ‘+’ ‘3’ ‘-’ ‘1’ ‘*’ ] in sequence shows intermediate result ‘4’
7. Pressing the keys [ ‘2’ ‘+’ ‘3’ ‘-’ ‘1’ ‘*’ ‘10’ ] in sequence shows operand ‘10’
8. Pressing the keys [ ‘2’ ‘+’ ‘3’ ‘-’ ‘1’ ‘*’ ‘10’ ‘=’ ] in sequence shows result ‘40’

Note that this is a simple calculator that does not follow BODMAS, and simply evaluates the stack in order as the keys are pressed, ie. 2 + 3 - 1 * 10 = 40 and not -5.


Goal 2

Add a single button toggle for Scientific Mode
This reveals 3 buttons:
1. Sign button (Flips the input from positive to negative, or vice versa)
2. Square button (Finds the square of the input)
3. Square Root button (Finds the square root of the input)

Goal 3

Add a 2-button toggle between ‘Light Theme’ and ‘Dark Theme’. 

In Light mode, the background color of the page should be white (#fff). The background color of the calculator buttons should be gray (#f0f0f0) and the font color should be black (#000).
In Dark mode, the background color of the page should be black (#000). The background color of the calculator buttons should be dark gray (#666) and the font color should be white (#fff).
